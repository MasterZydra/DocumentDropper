# Document Dropper
Document Dropper is a tool that automatically moves files in directories. Rules determine where the files get moved.  
*Written in [Embarcadero Delphi 10.2](https://www.embarcadero.com/en/products/delphi/starter) with Firemonkey for multiple platforms (currently Windows and Mac).*

With this program you can select source and destination directories. The definition of rules determines which file is moved to which directory.
