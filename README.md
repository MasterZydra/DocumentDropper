# Document Dropper
Document Dropper is a tool that automatically moves files in directories. Rules determine where the files get moved.  
*Written in [Embarcadero Delphi 10.2](https://www.embarcadero.com/en/products/delphi/starter) with Firemonkey for multiple platforms (currently Windows and Mac).*

With this program you can select source and destination directories. The definition of rules determines which file is moved to which directory.

For detailed instructions on how to use the application, please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/MasterZydra/DocumentDropper/wiki).
